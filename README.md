Hello viewers, this is a real-time weather application🚀🚀 previewing the current weather☁ of any city worldwide🌍, displaying local time⏲, date of that particular city, current user location🗺, and also hourly as well as 3 days forecast also. In this build, I have used React JS, Day JS (Date and Time), React-Toastify (Notification), Weather-API (API call), and Firebase (Hosting).
